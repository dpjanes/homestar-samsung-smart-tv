# About

This [Module](https://homestar.io/about/things) allows you to control your Samsung Smart TV devices from IOTDB and Homeâ˜†Star.

Note that "Samsung Smart TV" is basically just a name. It's not really that Smart, and not all Samsung Smart TVs will work with this because reasons.

After installation (see below) you can test compatibility by trying

	$ homestar samsung-send KEY_POWEROFF
	
which should turn off your TV. There's no corresponding way to turn on the TV unfortunately, as the Internet connection is not there when the TV is off.
